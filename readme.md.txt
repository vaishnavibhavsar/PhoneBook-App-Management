## Brief about the functions and implementation
### 1. Create Contact:
The person gets two choices whether to create a new contacct or add to existing contact.
We have used linked list in a linked to store multiple contacts since it is dynamic.
User can enter as many contact numbers to a single contact name .
### 2.Update Contact:
There is a facility provided to user to update the contact name as well as contact number.
### 3.Delete Contact:
Just similar to our real life contact book app user can delete a particular Contact
### 4.Display Contacts:
This function displays all contacts wit their respective contact numbers.
It also shows the total number of contacts.
### 5.Recommendation:
Recall how we search names in our contact book. We just type some charachters present in that 
particular conatact name to be searched. They may be present at start or somewhere in between
and press the search button.Similary , this functions gives you the recommende contacts for 
which you have typed certain characters and also displays number of results.
### 6. Make a phone call:
It is just the normal function which takes the contact name from user for whom he/she wants to call.
It simply displays a message that it has successfully called a particular contact.
### 7.Recently dialed numbers
When we make a call and check our call logs we see the last dialed calls.
Simulating the same to display the recently dialed calls in the phonebook
by makig use of stack.
